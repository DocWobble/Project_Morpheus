# NOTES.md

> Scratchpad for your transient ideas. Jot down any reasoning log elements that would be helpful to future agents but do not otherwise fit in a category.
> If a note survives more than a day or informs work, convert it into:
> - a `GOALS.md` capability (intent), and/or
> - a `DECISIONS.log` entry (trade-off), and/or
> - a scene (behaviour).

Use terse bullets. Avoid design docs hereâ€”promote them or delete them.
